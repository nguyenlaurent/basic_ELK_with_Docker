# basic_ELK_with_Docker
This is a school project that aims to have a first view of Elastic Logstash and Kibana stack (ELK), using a Docker container.

The repository contains the report, that includes the command lines to build the container from a pre-initialized ELK container (https://elk-docker.readthedocs.io). On the latter was added Packetbeat to collect network packets. As a demo were used PCAP files of a cybersecurity conference (https://www.netresec.com/?page=PCAP4SICS).
